        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an Online Marketing specialist with focus on PPC and SEM. I have managed paid search campaigns with limited to very large budgets, and my 7+years of experience include working with startup and scaleup companies with different business types and goals. </p>
        <p>I like to think my specialty is helping businesses export and grow internationally, which is why I'm doing my best to localize my efforts in 5+ different languages. In case the language of the target market is one I don't speak, I consult my ad creatives with native speakers.</p>
        <p>Aside from that, I have managed an in-house marketing team of PPC specialists, which has helped me develop and strengthen my skills in marketing leadership and training.</p>
        <p>The main platforms I use are (but not limited to) Google Ads/Adwords and Analytics, Facebook Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Bing, Yandex.Direct. </p>

                <p>I have worked with Boryana for few years. She is one of people who made me fall in love with online marketing and PPC. I have seen many people amazingly grow and develop under her leadership and coaching. Working with her was always very fulfilling and entertaining. Boryana can do great long- & short-term strategic decisions and lead team to make things happen. She is able to see big picture but also stay on top of all news and updates in online world. Bory is very likable person and can spread good atmosphere around her.</p>

                <p>Boryana helped us build the marketing team & efforts for TechBBQ 2018. She was always keen to help form new experiments & test, take lead on them and follow through to the end collecting the data and analysing the results. Boryana was always a great resource to have since she has a good, broad knowledge of many marketing tools & techniques meaning you always had a great partner to spar with and someone you could rely on to take ownership of different areas knowing they were in capable hands.</p>

                <p>If you're in need of reliable and adequate PPC specialist - you came to the right place. I've worked with Boryana for 4 years since we were both marketing assistants and mostly junior PPC specialists. She can do it all - regular upkeep of advertising campaigns, coming up with new ideas to test and try for her local market, learn new things and also seeing the global picture of paid promotion. Boryana is a universal advertising specialist but even better team manager. During my last year at Webnode I had a chance to work with Boryana as my boss aka head of PPC team. She can keep the balance of technical skills of ppc and team managing abilities.</p>
