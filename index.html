      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am an Online Marketing specialist with focus on PPC and SEM. I have managed paid search campaigns with limited to very large budgets, and my 7+years of experience include working with startup and scaleup companies with different business types and goals. </p>
      <p>I like to think my specialty is helping businesses export and grow internationally, which is why I'm doing my best to localize my efforts in 5+ different languages. In case the language of the target market is one I don't speak, I consult my ad creatives with native speakers.</p>
      <p>Aside from that, I have managed an in-house marketing team of PPC specialists, which has helped me develop and strengthen my skills in marketing leadership and training.</p>
      <p>The main platforms I use are (but not limited to) Google Ads/Adwords and Analytics, Facebook Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Bing, Yandex.Direct. </p>

            <p>Why is it crucial for any company ready to export their product, to count with a comprehensive strategy addressing new markets in a local way? First off, as much as English has become an international language of digital expression, not surprisingly not everybody speaks it! That said, research and hands-on practice have shown that even Millenials and people who are generally comfortable with English, give a much better response when they receive advertising content in their own language.</p>

            <p>Whether you're just starting out, or already have a PPC account running for some time, the possibilities for optimising campaign performance are nearly endless. I strongly believe in several principals definitive to success: there ought to be a good ongoing testing cycle in place; never make a decision based purely on intuition - there should be enough data to support it; always keep up with the latest and freshest in the industry.</p>
